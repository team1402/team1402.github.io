	<h2>Ethical Reflection: Written by Nghia Pham</h2>
	<p>
		Online learning industry is developing rapidly in the last decay because of the development of technology. Online-learning has completely changed the way students and teachers working with each other. Our topic was about two platforms: Discord and Teams, which are two of the most popular applications for online learning. We choose this topic because of the situation of the COVID 19 on the world make virtual class become commonly used. We research about the opportunity, risk, and choices of those applications
		<br>
		<br>
		During the period when COVID 19 pandemic was serious, schools and universities have been closed many times for weeks or even months. Online learning become a method that help students and teachers can continue to work with each other. Thanks to some applications like Teams and Discord, teacher can deliver their lessons live to every student at the same time without having a meeting in person. Students and teachers can also send files to each other just by some simple manipulations. That is means no more email with dozens of receivers which might lead to omission on someone. That is also means no more printing in large number every time students need to have a hard copy of a document. As the first-year student, I am one person who is benefit from this since all my assignment could be done and submit online, which save me a lot from printing fee, comparing to when I was in high school last year. Besides, when ever students need help, they can do the one-on-one call or direct message their teacher by the feature of these applications. Students could also use the group chat features to seek help from the other students which sometime is really helpful.
		<br>
		<br>
		But everything has both positive and negative sides. Although Teams and Discord bring to the user on education user many helpful features, students take advantage of this for academic fraud. By switching to this method of study, everything become online, and it becomes harder to control. Students might prefer Discord for this purpose since the teaching team do not have the right to access the history of the actions of their student’s account. Students can easily create a new channel, where they can share their test questions and answer or their answer to an assignment. They could also use the voice chat channel feature to do their online exam together if the teaching team don’t require to turn on student’s camera and mic. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Overall, online learning is completely changing the way we study. We can see many positive aspects in this method. On the other side, switching to online learning might create new kind of cheating by students. In my opinion, academic fraud is always existed and will always be exist, so what we could do is add more feature to the online learning platform which will help minimise the rate of cheating case from students.

	<h2>Ethical Reflection: Written by Jamie Lee</h2>
	<p>
		Due to the effect of the pandemic, the way we learn has changed. 
		The classes are held online, we sit our exams online, and we also have to work on our group projects online. 
		Our team has chosen &#x27Communication Platforms in Education and Learning&#x27 as our topic of choice due to its current relevance, and also because we are experiencing an increased usage of online learning first-handedly. 
		The two main technologies that we focused on are Discord, and Teams. 
		We explored the opportunities, risks, and choices of using these technologies.
		<br>
		<br>
		Discord and Teams are one of the reasons why students and teachers are able to communicate outside of schools and campuses. 
		With covid, our country went through several lockdowns that prevented the students and faculty members from going into school, which caused a lot of difficulties. 
		However, Teams made online classes possible with its features such as video chat with multiple people at once, and Discord contributed a big part by being a platform that allows students to discuss their issues. 
		One of the advantages of using Teams is that you can create a team that is dedicated to a class for teachers to upload and share necessary documents, and a discussion forum can also be created within the team. 
		This allows the students and teaching teams to communicate real-time, and the chat system allows a private conversation between just two people as well. 
		Personally, I am using Teams to communicate with my mentor from Women in Tech mentorship program. 
		Unlike emails, because I have Teams app downloaded on my phone, I get notifications instantly when I receive a message from my mentor, which makes the conversation go much quicker. 
		The similar things apply to Discord. 
		When a server is created, students in the same cohort can join and have discussions as well as one-on-one chat if needed. 
		People get to see what is shared on the group chat, which is very helpful as sometimes, you learn from other people&#x27s questions.
		<br>
		<br>
		As much as Teams and Discord are helpful, there are also risks that come with their helpful features. 
		Especially on Discord, there has been a lot of plagiarism happening as most of the times, teaching team are not part of the server. 
		The lack of moderation makes it easier for students to cheat and due to the pandemic, more and more students have started cheating in their assessments. 
		Like mentioned in the group component, it has been found that University of Auckland students admitted how answers to the assessments have been shared on Discord servers. 
		Although I have not yet to come across anything like that in person, there could be one on one chat going on behind the scenes that we never know of. 
		The Discord server that we have for our BCIS 1st year students are moderated by a team of students quite well. 
		However, because a lot of students feel more comfortable asking questions to each other, teaching teams might not be aware of what students are struggling with. 
		This was mentioned by Steffan from our Programming 1 paper. 
		He even suggested us to refrain from using Discord for main source of help as him as a lecturer needs to know the difficulties that his students are having. 
		The similar risks apply to Teams. 
		With its video chat and screen sharing features, it is easier for students to share their answers by using those features. 
		Especially with video chats, there is no evidence left when the call is finished, which makes it harder for them to get caught. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Both Discord and Teams have advantages and disadvantages. 
		Choosing only one technology or banning the other is not really an option as it will create even sneakier methods for students to plagiarise. 
		By enhancing their features and trying to overcome the disadvantages, these technologies can be used to its best potential. 
		For example, Teams can be used mainly for online classes and breakout rooms. 
		For Discord, if the teaching teams are involved in the server, that would create an environment where everyone tries to be careful not to go against academic integrity. 
		It is not possible to stop students from committing academic fraud, but it is possible to reduce and minimise the rate by embracing both their opportunities and risks.

	<h2>Ethical Reflection: Written by Samantha Heuss</h2>
	<p>
		As a group, we have analysed the effects of communication platforms in education and learning, and what measures can be taken to mitigate the risks posed by this. 
		From this, a decision should be made about whether, ethically right now, these communication platforms are suitable for education. 
		From all the research collated and assessed, I do not believe that it is ethically appropriate to use these communication platforms for educational purposes.
		<br>
		<br>
		One of the key points outlined in the risks was the lack of moderation. 
		The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the use of communication platforms such as Discord and Microsoft Teams for education at a rapid rate that studies cannot keep up with. 
		This results in the number of risks becoming far greater than the solutions to them. 
		The lack of moderation compromises academic integrity and increases the use of plagiarism between peers. 
		In the choices, I had outlined possible solutions to this, suggesting software for this monitorisation or training/bringing in staff specifically to monitor these platforms in use for education.
		<br>
		<br>
		The lack of research and development of these communication platforms for educational purposes is nowhere near where it should be to deem appropriate for this use. 
		This yet another issue raised. 
		Because the use of these platforms in education is so new, there are little studies into it. 
		Those I could find either occurred before the pandemic, and/or had many recommendations for further studies to be carried out. 
		Without these studies, less is known about the impacts of these platforms on learning, and therefore most risks are not discovered, and appropriate solutions put in place. 
		This implies that the effects on students and teachers are not adequately considered, and the students&#x27 education potentially harmed. 
		There therefore needs to be more done to understand what these communication platforms are doing to the education of students. 
		It is important to note that systems such as these are ever changing, and it would therefore be impossible to identify all the risks and solutions to these. 
		Identifying the vast majority of these is a more effective target to aim for. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Despite these risks, there are many opportunities that would make the use of communication platforms for education applicable in the future once the risks have been mitigated. 
		The introduction of these platforms to education meant that students could continue their learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
		I moved to Auckland to begin my final two years of high school in a predominantly online learning environment. 
		During this time, I used Microsoft teams for my scheduled lessons through the meetings function, complete and upload assignments, chat with my peers and teachers when I required assistance, etc. 
		I found Microsoft Teams helpful in these aspects, but I could clearly see the flaws. 
		I hadn&#x27t used Discord before starting university and am yet to interact with it in the way I had used Microsoft Teams for teaching. 
		My experience with Discord is limited to only chatting and interacting with my peers on a wide range of topics, both school related and not. 
		I therefore do not believe I can make a fair decision on Discord on my own experience alone. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The main point I am trying to make in this assessment/reflection is that I do believe these communication platforms for education and learning are ethically suitable, just not at present. 
		Not until the measures I have mentioned above are first put in place. 
		There are far too many risks that do affect the education of students and teachers for these platforms like Discord and Microsoft Teams to meet the purpose they were introduced into education for. 
		In this moment, the disadvantages do outweigh the advantages. 
		<br>
		<br>
		There is another key point that should be addressed here, and that is the comparison of these communication platforms. 
		This was something we went into our investigation wanting to do but changed our views about with the research gained. 
		In my own opinion, it wasn&#x27t about which communication platform was best for education and learning, but rather an institution with the purpose of education could make a fair assessment of which platform is best for them specifically. 
		My research turned to a more general direction, focused around whether communication platforms were suitable for educational purposes. 
		The common response from this was that no, there isn&#x27t enough known about the impacts on, and enough being done about, the education of students with these communication platforms. 
		And is why I do not believe that the use of communication platforms in education and learning is ethically pertinent at present.
