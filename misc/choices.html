<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<h2>Written by Samantha Heuss</h2>

<p>
	When analysing the impacts of communication platforms in education and learning, choices can be made to develop its positive contributions that will enhance learning. 
	In a study carried out by Kruglyk et al (2020) that focused on the convenience and practicality of Discord on education, students and teachers were asked “In your opinion, is it important to further develop the system of remote communication?”. 
	The recorded responses showed 82.35% of students and teachers responded “Yes”, 2.94% responded “No”, and 14.71% responded “It is difficult to answer”. 
	In this case study, it is important that note that it focuses solely on Discord and does not compare it to other communication platforms. 
	From the responses of this survey, it can be concluded that improvements can, and should be made to further develop Discord, and therefore other communication platforms, for education and learning.
<br>
<br>
	In the risks, the issue of plagiarism and lack of moderation of communication between students relating to Discord was discussed. 
	This too was highlighted in the study carried out by Kruglyk et al (2020). 
	In this, the importance of adding a form of moderation, such as through an audit journal, was suggested. 
	Doing so, would allow teachers and/or moderators of the students&#x27 platforms to be verify and monitor the actions of students. 
	This would likely decrease the chances of plagiarism and increase the value of information and help that can be received by students when using Discord. 
	This would therefore allow teachers/educators to securely engage with students without fear of breaching academic integrity.
<br>
<br>
	Microsoft Teams was another communication tool that was analysed to understand its effectiveness in education and learning. 
	Martin & Lapp (2019) recommends for future use of Microsoft Teams those educators undergo comprehensive training of the platform to ensure they can meet the educational needs of their student&#x27s. 
	In the risks, the issue of illicit screen sharing was raised. This issue too goes back to the need for moderation of these communication platforms to a higher standard. 
	It also reflects the need to provide educators with adequate training to be able to detect when this might occur, and how to assist students with their learning to minimise the need for this. 
	Like teachers, students should also receive training around the use of these communication platforms. 
	The statement, “Students nowadays are familiar with technology information but it does not guarantee that these students can use online learning applications well.” (Wea & Kuki, 2022) emphasises this need.  
	Doing so would allow students to fully grasp the skills they need for the use of these communication platforms, and therefore know how to access and use the resources provided by their teachers to better their education.
<br>
<br>
	The use of multiple communication platforms for learning can be advantageous in regard to the different tool&#x27s students will gain access to, to enhance their learning. 
	However, it can also become disadvantageous if not executed appropriately, instead causing students to search multiple platforms and communication channels to find the information they require for their learning. 
	Rojabi (2020) in the conclusion of their study made many recommendations of further studies that would improve Microsoft Teams for educational purposes. 
	Some of the key recommendations were to investigate how students participate and engage with these communication platforms, as well as the benefits that come from using Microsoft Team specifically towards students. 
	Though the benefits have discussed in the Opportunities, there is still more that can be done to understand how Microsoft Teams, and Discord, can be furthered developed. 
	Thereby focusing on the sustainability of the communication platforms in education and learning moving forward. 
<br>
<br>
	Another issue outlined in the study by Wea & Kuki (2022) was “The constraints faced are more specific to internet quota and inadequate internet network.” 
	By not addressing this issue, students, and teachers, without access to a device are at a disadvantage with the move towards online learning. 
	During the start of the pandemic and lockdowns in New Zealand, the Ministry of Education in New Zealand sought to eradicate this issue as best they could to give each New Zealand equal access to education. 
	Overall, they supplied 80,000 students, or 45,000 households, with internet access. 
	36,000 students also received devices to carryout their online learning with (Dowden, 2022). 
	Measures such as these can be taken elsewhere to ensure students have access to communication platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Discord for their education and learning.
