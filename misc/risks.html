<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<h2>Written by Jamie Lee</h2>

	Discord is one of the most popular communication platforms used within university students. 
	As much as it is helpful, it is known that Discord can sometimes cause breaches of academic integrity. 
	Most of the times, when a server is created for a cohort, the lecturers or the teaching teams are not a part of the server. 
	This creates an easier environment for students to plagiarise accidentally or purposefully as the posts or the chats are not being moderated by the university&#x27s staff members. 
	The server that we have for our BCIS 2022 first year students have moderators, and they encourage not to ask questions that are related directly to the answers. 
	However, because anyone can message each other privately on Discord, although the conversations in the server might not lead to plagiarism, some people could be having one-on-one chats exchanging answers. (McNamara & Zachmeier, 2021) 
	Alongside of this issue, like Steffan from Programming 1 class has pointed out, if the students only communicate and asks questions to each other, the teaching team is left blindsided to what the students are struggling with, which goes against the purpose of Discord, which is communication. 
	According to PlagiarismToday, it was found that students were sharing answers for the Advanced Placement (AP) exams. 
	A survey that was taken by 1,967 school faculty members shows that 60% of them believe that “academic fraud is more common in online courses.” (Bailey, 2020) 
	It is also proven by an anonymous student from The University of Auckland, that Discord is where most of the cheating happens. 
	It is mentioned in the article that the students share their answers in the group chat, and the students think that not cheating is considered “being at a disadvantage” as there are many numbers of students who treat cheating the same as boxers taking enhancement drugs. (Franks, 2021) 
	On The University of Auckland website&#x27s academic integrity in online assessment, it is explicitly mentioned that a student is not allowed to share any contents from the assessments on social media platforms. (Auckland, n.d.). 
	However, it is unknown that the faculty members are aware of every single thing that happens behind the scenes. 
	There are no major research done for the risks of using Microsoft Teams and how it can lead to plagiarism, but based on the functions that Teams provide, the similar concept of risk applies to Teams as well. 
	Unless you are in a breakout room, the teaching team can&#x27t monitor the conversations that happen outside of the meeting. 
	The screen sharing and video calls can be considered another helpful learning tool until the students start taking advantages of no tracks being left when in the call. 
	Teams&#x27 screen share feature can be misused during exams or for assignments as people could share their screens and exchange answers in a group call.
