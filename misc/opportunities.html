<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
<h2>Written by Nghai Pham</h2>
<center>
<p>
	Online learning has been started from 1960 by the University of Illinois, USA (Adamas, 2020). 
	Although this method has been invented and start using from that year, it still has not been apply much since the difficulty of the distance learning. 
	Thanks to the development of technology, by time, many students starting feel that online learning is better, but this number still was not the majority. 
	“Approximately 33% of college students take a course online” (Online Education Statistic &#8211 How COVID-19 Changed the Way We Learn). 
	From the end of 2019 until now, the COVID-19 pandemic happens make people need to limit direct contact with each other; Schools and universities have been close for a long time since they are location which contain high risk of spreading the virus. 
	Therefore, online learning become such a powerful method in this situation, since it helps students can continue their study without having a class in person so they could stay safe. 
	The most important part of online learning is the platforms, but I will discuss about Discord and Teams only since they are two of the most popular online communication platforms. 
<br>
<br>
	Both Discord and Teams are communication platform that can work on browser, or through a downloadable application, which allow users to join or create a server (group). 
	Although the original purpose of Discord is for gaming while Teams is for business, we can utilize these platforms as a virtual classroom because of their features. 
<br>
<br>
	First, both applications allow the person with the authority to create channel. 
	We could have multiple channels in a server and each of them act as topic-specific spaces where you can discuss about a certain thing. 
	We can use this feature to create a “Q&A forum for questions about shared lesson where students can help each other, but teachers can also jump into assist” (Discord Moderator Academy, 2022), this is applied for both applications. 
<br>
<br>
	Secondly with Discord we can create a voice channel which allow the members of the sever to join, share screens, and discussing via voice. 
	The person with authorization can control the call like disabled voice activity for students. 
	With this feature, teacher can provide online lesson live. 
	Teacher can also put their students in multiple channels for group activity and jump in each channel to check around, just like when they walk to each group in offline class. 
	This feature can also help teacher provide a 1 on 1 tutorial with student who need help in a lock channel which only person with authorization can join and give someone permission to join. 
	Team also has those feature we just listed above except it works as a meeting(call). 
	Team also has break-out room function which can randomly assign student into group with number of members. 
<br>
<br>
	Finally, when using Discord and Teams, we could reduce the number of emails need to be sent and reply. 
	Both applications allow user to upload their files and send it to others. 
	Teachers now can just upload the file to the channel and all the students can access and download it. 
	They will not have attached the file to an email and sent it to everyone who is need it.
<br>
<br>
	There are some functions which are helpful for students with their study only available in Teams but not for Discord. 
	First is the recording function. 
	With Teams, user can record the meeting and watch is again many times as they want. 
	With the feature, teachers could record the lecture and post it in the channel so students could watch them again just in case they missed the session or basically just could not follow up some part of the session. 
	The recording could be watch at anytime anywhere with a device and internet, which give students the flexibility to manage their time. 
<br>
<br>
	Secondly, Team users could improve their collaboration and communication thanks to the tight integration with Office 365. 
	This is means that user do not have to switch app while using Teams. 
	They could easily create the Word, Excel, PowerPoint documents in Teams, and share it with the others and co-author it.  
	That means the user do not have gave each other different versions of the document any time they make a change anymore (Winqvist, 2022). 
	With this feature, the collaboration will improve in both productivity way and time saving.
<br>
<br>
	Overall, both application I just mention above could be utilized become a virtual class which has enough functions to provide good quality of education. 
	It&#x27s easy to understand while Teams has more functions serve the education purpose than Discord since Teams need to be paid to use while Discord is free. 
	Each school, classes can consider those factors choose their applications or they might want to have both.
